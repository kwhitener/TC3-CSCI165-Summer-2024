/*
 * In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, 
 * is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which 
 * each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
 * 
 * For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
 * The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
 * 
 * The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, 
 * such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. 
 * As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice
 * offers essentially no communications security.
 * 
 * (But is pretty cool for learning about encryption and decryption) <-- my comment
 * (And it's a good example of a simple class) <-- my comment
 * (And it's a good example of string manipulation) <-- my comment
