Final Project will be due Wednesday 5/15/2024 by 8:30 am, with no exceptions. 

No late work will be accepted.

The class periods of 5/6 and 5/8 will be open lab days for project work and I will have office hours scheduled
during the beginning of final exam week. Those will be posted asap.

Our final exam is scheduled for Wednesday 5/15/2024 from 8:00 am - 10:20 am. The exam will be given in class.
If you have a legitimate reason for why you cannot take the exam in person, please contact me privately and we will work something out.
